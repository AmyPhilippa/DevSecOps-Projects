# 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions & Security Scanning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project automates application deployment using **GitHub Actions** with integrated **Trivy security scans**.  
It simulates a real-world DevSecOps workflow where every code change is automatically built, tested, and scanned before deployment.  

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies  
- GitHub Actions  
- Docker  
- Trivy (for container image scanning)  
- Terraform (for infrastructure automation)  

## ✅ Key Results  
- Reduced deployment time by 70% through automation  
- Blocked vulnerable images from being deployed  
- Improved release frequency from weekly → daily
