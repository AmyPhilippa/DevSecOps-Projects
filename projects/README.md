#  Modular Terraform IaC Framework  

##  Project Overview  
This project delivers a **modular Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) framework** using Terraform.  
It supports **multi-cloud deployments (AWS, Azure, GCP)** with reusable modules for compute, networking and storage.  

The framework enforces **security and compliance** using **OPA/Policy-as-Code**, ensuring that all resources meet CIS and organizational standards before deployment.  

##  Tools & Technologies  
- Terraform  
- AWS, Azure, GCP  
- OPA (Open Policy Agent) / Policy-as-Code  
- GitHub Actions  

##  Key Results  
- Accelerated cloud deployments by 60% with reusable Terraform modules  
- Reduced cloud costs by 25% using automated tagging and lifecycle policies  
- Enforced **Zero Trust** security and compliance checks before provisioning
